# Audit Summary

This document provides a quick overview based on the checklists in
[`audit-checklist.md`](audit-checklist.md) and the outstanding observations in
[`issues-2025-07-05.md`](issues-2025-07-05.md).

## Key Checks

- Review of privileged functions such as `pause`, `createPlan` and
  `processPayment`.
- Verification of role assignments (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`) and
  owner privileges.
- Validation of edge cases like price feed decimals, stale oracle data and
  duplicate subscriptions.

These items are covered in detail in the audit checklist and have been
implemented in the current code base.

## Outstanding Issues

The static analysis run on 2025‑07‑05 reported no high severity findings. Slither
highlighted various low or informational warnings (e.g. the
"arbitrary-from" transfer pattern and naming conventions). Mythril reported no
issues. Most of these warnings originate from upstream dependencies and remain
open for future cleanup but do not block deployment.

## Status

- **Resolved:** Core security checks and reentrancy protection are implemented.
- **Open:** Minor Slither warnings and style recommendations.
