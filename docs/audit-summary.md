# Audit Summary

This document provides a quick overview based on the checklists in
[`audit-checklist.md`](audit-checklist.md). Earlier issue logs have been
archived and are no longer part of the repository.

## Key Checks

- Review of privileged functions such as `pause`, `createPlan` and
  `processPayment`.
- Verification of role assignments (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`) and
  owner privileges.
- Validation of edge cases like price feed decimals, stale oracle data and
  duplicate subscriptions.

These items are covered in detail in the audit checklist and have been
implemented in the current code base.

## Outstanding Issues

The most recent static analysis run reported no high severity findings. Previous
warnings around the transfer pattern and variable naming have been addressed in
the core contracts. Remaining Slither messages stem from upstream OpenZeppelin
libraries and are kept for reference but do not block deployment. Mythril
reported no issues.

## Status

- **Resolved:** Core security checks and reentrancy protection are implemented.
- **Open:** Minor Slither warnings and style recommendations.
