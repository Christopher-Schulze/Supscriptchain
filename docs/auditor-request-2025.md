# Auditor Engagement Request (July 2025)

Following the static analysis outlined in [audit-plan.md](audit-plan.md) we would like to engage a professional auditor.

## Scope

All Solidity contracts under `contracts/` plus accompanying TypeScript tests in `test/`.

## Materials Provided

- Current repository commit with build artifacts and tests
- Static analysis report: `docs/slither-output.txt`
- Issue summary: `docs/issues-2025-07-05.md`

Please review the code base and provide a detailed security audit report including recommendations. We estimate the effort to be similar to the 2â€‘4 week engagement described in `audit-plan.md`.
