# Open Issues from Static Analysis

This document summarizes warnings found by `slither` and `mythril`.

## Slither Results (167 findings)

- **Arbitrary-from transfer** in `BaseSubscription._processPayment` â€“ flagged because `safeTransferFrom` transfers from the user, not `msg.sender`. This is expected behavior but should be documented. *(Low)*
- **Incorrect exponentiation (`^`)** detected in OpenZeppelin `Math` libraries. These come from upstream dependencies and are informational. *(Info)*
- **Divide before multiply** warnings in the same Math libraries. Upstream issue only. *(Info)*
- **Naming convention** violations for many parameters and variables. Consider renaming for clarity. *(Info)*
- **Redundant expressions** in `BaseSubscription` oracle struct unpacking. Could be simplified. *(Info)*
- **Constants not declared constant** in `EIP712` and `ERC20Permit` from OpenZeppelin. Upstream informational issue. *(Info)*
- **Too many digits** literal in `ShortStrings.sol` from OpenZeppelin. *(Info)*

## Mythril Results

Analysis of the compiled `Subscription` bytecode with a 60 second timeout reported **no issues**.

Overall no high severity problems were detected. Most findings come from external dependencies or style suggestions.
