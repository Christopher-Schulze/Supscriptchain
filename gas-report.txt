## Gas Report

Optimization applied in `BaseSubscription` to reduce repeated storage reads. `_getPaymentAmount` now accepts a storage pointer and call sites preload plan data before checks. This slightly lowered gas costs for key functions.

### Before
- `subscribe` avg: 176,899 gas (Subscription) / 181,844 gas (SubscriptionUpgradeable)
- `processPayment` avg: 101,162 gas (SubscriptionUpgradeable) / 84,062 gas (SubscriptionUpgradeableV2)

### After
- `subscribe` avg: 176,652 gas (Subscription) / 181,597 gas (SubscriptionUpgradeable)
- `processPayment` avg: 101,071 gas (SubscriptionUpgradeable) / 83,971 gas (SubscriptionUpgradeableV2)
